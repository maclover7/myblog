Welcome to my blog! I post about whatever cool technical topics I am
currently dealing with or working on. Since I am a Ruby developer, blog
posts usually center around Ruby, Rails, or the surrounding ecosystem. I
am also a huge fan of deployment services, like Flynn, that make it
easier to self host applications.

If you ever want to get in touch with me, the best way is usually
through email, or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/applerebel).
